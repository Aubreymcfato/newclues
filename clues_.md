Once were we young in the Garden...
a. The Internet is us, connected.
http://real.URL.coming.soon/\#subhead-0
1 The Internet is not made of copper wire, glass fiber, radio waves, or even tubes.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#1
Embed the clue:
2 The devices we use to connect to the Internet are not the Internet.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#2
Embed the clue:
3 Verizon, Comcast, AT&T, Deutsche Telekom, and 中国电信 do not own the Internet. Facebook, Google, and Amazon are not the Net's monarchs, nor yet are their minions or algorithms. Not the governments of the Earth nor their Trade Associations have the [consent of the networked](http://consentofthenetworked.com/) to bestride the Net as sovereigns.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#3
Embed the clue:
4 We hold the Internet in common and as unowned.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#4
Embed the clue:
5 From us and from what we have built on it does the Internet derive all its value.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#5
Embed the clue:
6 The Net is of us, by us, and for us.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#6
Embed the clue:
7 The Internet is ours.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#7
Embed the clue:
b. The Internet is nothing and has no purpose.
http://real.URL.coming.soon/\#subhead-1
8 The Internet is not a thing any more than gravity is a thing. Both pull us together.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#8
Embed the clue:
9 The Internet is no-thing at all. [At its base](http://www.worldofends.com/) the Internet is a set of agreements, which the geeky among us (long may their names be hallowed) call "protocols," but which we might, in the temper of the day, call "commandments."
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#9
Embed the clue:
10 The first among these is: Thy network shall move all packets closer to their destinations without favor or delay based on origin, source, content, or intent.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#10
Embed the clue:
11 Thus does this First Commandment lay open the Internet to every idea, application, business, quest, vice, and whatever.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#11
Embed the clue:
12 There has not been a tool with such a general purpose since language.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#12
Embed the clue:
13 This means the Internet is not for anything in particular. Not for social networking, not for documents, not for advertising, not for business, not for education, not for porn, not for anything. It is specifically designed for everything.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#13
Embed the clue:
14 [Optimizing](http://books.google.com/books?id=9lTtWQlLkwwC&pg=PA56&lpg=PA56&dq=optimizing+de-optimizing+david+reed&source=bl&ots=_mqGSLoqSV&sig=TWO4uUTWkzGPDBGmwyS0uqBz0NA&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Nm5lVN-hJtbdsASnzoKQAQ&ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=optimizing%20de-optimizing%20david%20reed&f=false) the Internet for one purpose de-optimizes it for all others.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#14
Embed the clue:
15 The Internet like gravity is indiscriminate in its attraction. It pulls us all together, the virtuous and the wicked alike.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#15
Embed the clue:
c. The Net is not content.
http://real.URL.coming.soon/\#subhead-2
16 There is great content on the Internet. But holy mother of cheeses, the Internet is not made out of content.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#16
Embed the clue:
17 A teenager's first poem, the blissful release of a long-kept secret, a fine sketch drawn by a palsied hand, a blog post in a regime that hates the sound of its people's voices — none of these people sat down to write content.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#17
Embed the clue:
18 Did we use the word "content" without quotes? We feel so dirty.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#18
Embed the clue:
d. The Net is not a medium.
http://real.URL.coming.soon/\#subhead-3
19 The Net is not a medium any more than a conversation is a medium.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#19
Embed the clue:
20 On the Net, we are the medium. We are the ones who move messages. We do so every time we post or retweet, send a link in an email, or post it on a social network.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#20
Embed the clue:
21 Unlike a medium, you and I leave our fingerprints, and sometimes bite marks, on the messages we pass. We tell people why we're sending it. We argue with it. We add a joke. We chop off the part we don't like. We make these messages our own.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#21
Embed the clue:
22 Every time we move a message through the Net, it carries a little bit of ourselves with it.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#22
Embed the clue:
23 We only move a message through this "medium" if it matters to us in one of the infinite ways that humans care about something.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#23
Embed the clue:
24 Caring — mattering — is the motive force of the Internet.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#24
Embed the clue:
e The Web is a Wide World.
http://real.URL.coming.soon/\#subhead-4
25 In 1991, [Tim Berners-Lee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee) used the Net to create a gift he gave freely to us all: the World Wide Web. Thank you.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#25
Embed the clue:
26 Tim created the Web by providing protocols (there's that word again!) that say how to write a page that can link to any other page without needing anyone's permission.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#26
Embed the clue:
27 Boom. Within ten years we had billions of pages on the Web — a combined effort on the order of a World War, and yet so benign that the biggest complaint was the \<blink\> tag.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#27
Embed the clue:
28 The Web is an impossibly large, semi-persistent realm of items discoverable in their dense inter-connections.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#28
Embed the clue:
29 That sounds familiar. Oh, yeah, that's what the world is.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#29
Embed the clue:
30 Unlike the real world, every thing and every connection on the Web was created by some one of us expressing an interest and an assumption about how those [small pieces](http://www.smallpieces.com/) go together.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#30
Embed the clue:
31 Every link by a person with something to say is an act of generosity and selflessness, bidding our readers leave our page to see how the world looks to someone else.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#31
Embed the clue:
32 The Web remakes the world in our collective, emergent image.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#32
Embed the clue:
But oh how we have strayed, sisters and brothers...
a. How did we let conversation get [weaponized](http://blog.bl00cyb.org/2014/11/akirachix-and-weaponized-social/), anyway?
http://real.URL.coming.soon/\#subhead-5
33 It's important to notice and cherish the talk, the friendship, the thousand acts of sympathy, kindness, and joy we encounter on the Internet.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#33
Embed the clue:
34 And yet we hear the words "fag" and "nigger" far more on the Net than off.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#34
Embed the clue:
35 Demonization of 'them' — people with looks, languages, opinions, memberships and other groupings we don't understand, like, or tolerate — is worse than ever on the Internet.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#35
Embed the clue:
36 Women in Saudi Arabia can't drive? Meanwhile, [half of us](https://medium.com/message/online-and-offline-violence-towards-women-4c854eb591a5) can't speak on the Net without [looking over our shoulders](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/aug/05/twitter-bomb-threats-women).
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#36
Embed the clue:
37 Hatred is present on the Net because it's present in the world, but the Net makes it easier to express and to hear.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#37
Embed the clue:
38 The solution: If we had a solution, we wouldn't be bothering you with all these damn clues.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#38
Embed the clue:
39 We can say this much: Hatred didn't call the Net into being, but it's holding the Net — and us — back.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#39
Embed the clue:
40 Let's at least acknowledge that the Net has values implicit in it. Human values.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#40
Embed the clue:
41 Viewed coldly the Net is just technology. But it's populated by creatures who are warm with what they care about: their lives, their friends, the world we share.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#41
Embed the clue:
42 The Net offers us a common place where we can be who we are, with others who delight in our differences.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#42
Embed the clue:
43 No one owns that place. Everybody can use it. Anyone can improve it.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#43
Embed the clue:
44 That's what an open Internet is. Wars have been fought for less.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#44
Embed the clue:
b. "We agree about everything. I find you *fascinating*!"
http://real.URL.coming.soon/\#subhead-6
45 The world is spread out before us like a buffet, and yet we [stick](http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/rewire-digital-cosmopolitans-in-the-age-of-connection/) with our steak and potatoes, lamb and hummus, fish and rice, or whatever.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#45
Embed the clue:
46 We do this in part because conversation requires a common ground: shared language, interests, norms, understandings. Without those, it's hard or even impossible to have a conversation.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#46
Embed the clue:
47 Shared grounds spawn tribes. The Earth's solid ground kept tribes at a distance, enabling them to develop rich differences. Rejoice! Tribes give rise to Us vs. Them and war. Rejoice? Not so much.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#47
Embed the clue:
48 On the Internet, the distance between tribes starts at zero.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#48
Embed the clue:
49 Apparently knowing how to find one another interesting is not as easy as it looks.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#49

50 That's a challenge we can meet by being open, sympathetic, and patient. We can do it, team! We're \#1! We're \#1!
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#50
Embed the clue:
51 Being welcoming: There's a value the Net needs to learn from the best of our real world cultures.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#51
Embed the clue:
c. Marketing still makes it harder to talk.
http://real.URL.coming.soon/\#subhead-7
52 We were right the [first time](http://www.cluetrain.com/): Markets are conversations.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#52
Embed the clue:
53 A conversation isn't your business tugging at our sleeve to shill a product we don't want to hear about.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#53
Embed the clue:
54 if we want to know the truth about your products, we'll find out from one another.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#54

55 We understand that these conversations are incredibly valuable to you. Too bad. They're ours.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#55
Embed the clue:
56 You're welcome to join our conversation, but only if you tell us who you work for, and if you can speak for yourself and as yourself.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#56
Embed the clue:
57 Every time you call us "consumers" we feel like cows looking up the word "meat."
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#57

58 Quit fracking our lives to extract data that's none of your business and that your machines misinterpret.

Embed the clue:
60 Ads that sound human but come from your marketing department's irritable bowels, stain the fabric of the Web.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#60
Embed the clue:
61 When personalizing something is creepy, it's a pretty good indication that you don't understand what it means to be a person.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#61
Embed the clue:
62 Personal is human. Personalized isn't.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#62
Embed the clue:
63 The more machines sound human, the more they slide down into the [uncanny valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley) where everything is a [creep](http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/12/the-year-we-get-creeped-out-by-algorithms/) [show](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/06/data-doppelgangers-and-the-uncanny-valley-of-personalization/372780/).

Embed the clue:
64 Also: Please stop dressing up ads as news in the hope we'll miss the little disclaimer hanging off their underwear.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#64
Embed the clue:
65 When you place a "[native ad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_advertising)," you're eroding not just your own trustworthiness, but the trustworthiness of this entire new way of being with one another.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#65
Embed the clue:
66 And, by the way, how about calling "native ads" by any of their real names: "product placement," "advertorial," or "fake fuckinggosh darn news"?
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#66
Embed the clue:
67 Advertisers got along without being creepy for generations. They can get along without being creepy on the Net, too.

71 [As we move from the Web](http://dashes.com/anil/2012/12/rebuilding-the-web-we-lost.html) to an [app-based world](https://indiewebcamp.com/Principles), we lose the commons we were building together.

78 If Facebook is your experience of the Net, then you've strapped on goggles from a company with a fiduciary responsibility to keep you from ever taking the goggles off.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#78
Embed the clue:
79 Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple are all in the goggles business.  The biggest truth their goggles obscure: These companies want to hold us the way black holes hold light.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#79
Embed the clue:

http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#84
Embed the clue:
85 If we want our government to back off, the deal has to be that if — when — the next attack comes, we can't complain that they should have surveilled us harder.
http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/\#85
